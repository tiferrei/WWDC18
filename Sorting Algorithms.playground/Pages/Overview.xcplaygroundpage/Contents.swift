/*:
Welcome! Sorting algorithms are a key concept of computing, they define different ways to sort and organise data.

 There are many different sorting algoriths, each with its pros and cons. These pros and cons are usually measured in something called the BigO Notation.

 This notation helps us document how "efficient" an algorithm is depending on the input it is given.

 In this page you'll be introduced to the Visualiser. It's a little tool (a `class`, actually) that I have developed to visualise sorting algorithms.

//: Initialise `Visualise` with a list of `Integers` to sort.

let graph = Visualise([12, 23, 8, 1, 5, 20, 23])
//#-end-editable-code
//: Have a play visualising the `Integers` you entered. When you're ready, we can move on to the [algorithms](@next).
