# Sorting Algorithms

Hi there, 

This playground came from a struggle to grasp sorting algorithms, I developed it mainly for me and my friends, to help us visualise them and better understand the algorithms we'd have to learn for our CS course.
I hope they help you better understanding them as well!

## Getting Started

If you're on macOS simply open the Playground with Xcode and it should be compatible with Swift 3.0 onwards.

If you'd like to generate a Playground Book for iPads, you can do so with [playgroundbooks](https://github.com/playgroundbooks/playgroundbook).
First clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/tiferrei/WWDC18
cd WWDC18
```

Install `playgroundbooks`:
```
[sudo] gem install playgroundbook
```

Build and export it:
```
playgroundbook render book.yaml
```

You should now have a playgroundbook in your current directory. You can AirDrop it or upload it to iCloud Drive.
